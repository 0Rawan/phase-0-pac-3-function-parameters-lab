## Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript functions lab! You'll notice a few new things in this
lesson that we haven't encountered before. Don't worry, we'll walk you through
them.

If you haven't already, fork and clone this lab into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code. (If you are using a different text editor, the command
will be different.) Finally, run `npm install` to install the lab's
dependencies.

### Code-Along

To start, open up `index.js` in your text editor. You should see, well, nothing.
We'll fix that soon.

Now open up `test/root.js`. Hey, there's something! What's all of this stuff
doing?

At the very top of the file, you'll see

``` javascript
global.expect = require('expect');

const babel = require('babel-core');
const jsdom = require('jsdom');
const path = require('path');
```

This might be a bit bewildering, but all we're doing is referencing different
_libraries_ that help us run the tests. You may recall that we talked about
_packages_ in an earlier lesson. A library is similar: it's code that someone
else (usually multiple someone elses) wrote for our use. The code above makes
the libraries available inside our test environment, which enables us to run the
tests.

If you go to `test/index-test.js`, you'll see

``` javascript
describe('shout(string)', function(){
  // there's stuff in here, too
})
```

`describe` is a function provided by our test runner (in this case, we're using
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)) &mdash; it's basically a container for our tests.

Let's take a closer look at that `describe()`:

``` javascript
describe('shout(string)', function(){
  it('receives one argument and returns it in all caps', function() {
    // we'll get to this in a sec
  })
})
```

These internal `describe()` calls are used for _describing_ the functions that
you're going to write. In this case, the test is saying, "Okay, I think there's
going to be a function called `shout`, and it should take one argument (it
doesn't actually matter what the argument is called, but `string`, is nice and
specific, don't you think?). It should _return_ that argument in all caps.

Finally, we have

``` javascript
expect(shout('hello')).toEqual('HELLO');
```

which says that it _expects_ a call to `shout()` with the string `'hello'` will
`equal` the string `'HELLO'`. This is the actual test &mdash; otherwise called a spec,
expectation, or assertion &mdash; for this function. We can have more than one test
per function, but let's start with this one.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, run `npm test` in the terminal. The first output you'll see will look like this:

```text
> java-script-intro-to-functions-lab@0.1.0 test /Users/mbenton/Desktop/curriculum-team/junk/javascript-intro-to-functions-lab
> mocha -R mocha-multi --reporter-options spec=-,json=.results.json --timeout 10000



  shout(string)
    1) receives one argument and returns it in all caps

  whisper(string)
    2) receives one argument and returns it in all lowercase

  logShout(string)
    3) calls console.log() its one argument in all caps

  logWhisper(string)
    4) calls console.log() its one argument in all lowercase

  sayHiToGrandma(string)
    5) returns "I can't hear you!" if `string` is lowercase
    6) returns "YES INDEED!" if `string` is uppercase
    7) returns "I love you, too." if `string` is "I love you, Grandma."`

     ReferenceError: sayHiToGrandma is not defined

      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)



npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
```

Hm, seven failed tests. Let's see if we can get that _first_ test to
pass. Open up `index.js`.

When we write our code, we follow the guidance of the tests. Let's take a look at that first error:

```text
  1) shout(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all caps:
     ReferenceError: shout is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:4:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)
```

This is the output that comes from this test in `index-test.js`:

```js
describe('shout(string)', function() {
  it('receives one argument and returns it in all caps', function() {
    expect(shout('hello')).toEqual('HELLO');
  })
})
```

This information tells us that the test is expecting a function called `shout` that accepts an argument but that `shout` isn't defined. So let's start by declaring our function in `index.js`:

``` javascript
function shout(string) {
}
```

We know we won't pass the test yet because our function doesn't do anything yet.
However, if we rerun the test, it should give us more information about what we
need to do:

```text
  1) shout(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all caps:
     Error: Expected undefined to equal 'HELLO'
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toEqual (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:81:30)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:4:28)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)
```

When we see `Error: Expected undefined to equal [something]`, we know that the test is looking for a `return` value. We can also see the description of what the function should do: it `receives one argument and returns it in all caps`.

Okay, so with that information, we know that our function should return whatever string is passed in as an argument:

``` javascript
function shout(string) {
  return string;
}
```

But we're still missing one piece: how do we make `string` all caps? JavaScript
has a built-in method for that! It's called `toUpperCase()`. We can call it on
any string:

``` javascript
'Hello!'.toUpperCase(); // 'HELLO!'
```

Above, we've called it directly on a literal string but, of course, we can also
call it on a variable. So let's try it with our `shout()` function:

``` javascript
function shout(string) {
  return string.toUpperCase();
}
```

and run our tests again. We get:

```test
shout(string)
    âœ“ receives one argument and returns it in all caps

  whisper(string)
    1) receives one argument and returns it in all lowercase

  logShout(string)
    2) calls console.log() its one argument in all caps

  logWhisper(string)
    3) calls console.log() its one argument in all lowercase

  sayHiToGrandma(string)
    4) returns "I can't hear you!" if `string` is lowercase
    5) returns "YES INDEED!" if `string` is uppercase
    6) returns "I love you, too." if `string` is "I love you, Grandma."`

Hey! We got one to pass! Six left.

## Your Turn

Now it's your turn to get the rest of the tests to pass. Note that some of them
require you to use `console.log()` instead of `return` &mdash; follow the
guidance of the tests!

In this lab, we're writing functions that "speak" at different volumes &mdash; they
whisper or they shout. The next test is similar to the first:

```text
1) whisper(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all lowercase:
     ReferenceError: whisper is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:10:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)
```

This test is telling us that `whisper(string)` receives one argument and returns
it in all lowercase. At the moment, the test is failing becasue whisper is not
defined.

> **Note:** Just like `.toUpperCase()` changes any string to all uppercase in JavaScript, `.toLowerCase()` (e.g., `'HELLO'.toLowerCase()`) changes any string to all lowercase.

The next two tests are checking to see if a specific string is logged when a
function is called. You will still need to use the `.toUpperCase()` and
`.toLowerCase()` methods for `logShout(string)` and `logWhisper(string)`. Keep in
mind though that these tests are not looking for return values, only logs.

The final function you need to create is `sayHiToGrandma()`. Grandma is a bit
hard of hearing, so whispering can be a bit difficult, but she'll always hear
you if you say, "I love you, Grandma." This time, you will need to return
different strings depending on the string passed into the function.

> **Note:** Although there are 3 tests for `sayHiToGrandma()`, you only need to write **one** function. This function should be able to handle all three test conditions:
> * If the string that is passed into the function is all lowercase, the function should return "I can't hear you!"
> * If the string that is passed into the function is all uppercase, the function should return "YES INDEED!"
> * If the string that is passed into the function is equal to "I love you, Grandma.", the function should return "I love you, too."

How do we check if a string is all lowercase or all uppercase?

```javascript
const uppercase = "HELLO!";

uppercase.toUpperCase() === uppercase; // true

const lowercase = 'hello!';

lowercase.toLowerCase() === lowercase; // true

const mixedCase = 'Hi there!';

mixedCase.toLowerCase() === mixedCase; // false

mixedCase.toUpperCase() === mixedCase; // false
```

We can simply check whether the string is the same when we convert it to
uppercase or lowercase! (The lines with the `===` comparisons are the ones that
check). If it's the same, then it was already in that case; if not, then it's
either in the other case or it's mixed case. Now that we know how to compare
strings, how can we use these comparisons to conditionally return different
strings? If you need a refresher, go back and review the lesson on Selection
with Conditionals.

Remember that punctuation is important! Humans might be able to understand that
"I love you Grandma" is close enough to "I love you, Grandma." and means the
same thing but JavaScript will not consider these equal!

Good luck!
